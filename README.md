### About

I began by reading the [task](https://github.com/woltapp/summer2021-internship). It specified that one could do the frontend or backend task. I choose to do the backend task with:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Typescript

---

### Execution
To get the Node web-app to work one only has to download the source code, and have installed:

* Node
* NPM
* NPX

Then after that `cd` in to the root folder and run: `npm install` (to install any dependencies). After that one can run `npx ts-node app.ts` or `npm start` to get the local server running.
